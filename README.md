### Sound localization application with microphone array technique

Sound localization is a signal processing technique that aims to determine the direction and distance of a sound source. Microphone arrays are commonly used in sound localization systems. By using multiple microphones arranged in a specific configuration, it becomes possible to analyze the differences in sound arrival times and intensities at each microphone, allowing the system to estimate the location of the sound source.

The program utilizes an array of 4, 6, or 8 microphones to implement a sound source localization method in three-dimensional space. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for selecting a data file containing recorded sound signals and choosing the array geometry. It is assumed that the sound recordings have been preprocessed via STM32 microcontrollers. Once the localization process is initiated, the program calculates the source location and displays the results in a 3D plot.

This program serves as a practical demonstration of sound localization techniques, allowing users to explore and understand the principles behind estimating the origin of sound using microphone arrays.
